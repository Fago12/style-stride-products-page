## Usage
This project fetches products from Contentful. Initially, it utilized a product.json file. For local usage, arrange product images accordingly. Images were removed from the images folder due to their sizes.

## Features
- Custom navigation bar that hides on scroll down and reveals on scroll up
- Fixed filter section that doesn't hide under the navigation bar despite being fixed
- Enhanced cart functionalities: products are removed when their count is zero
- Support for filtering by search, categories, and price, and some other cool features

## Demo
A link would be provided soon
